1. Title: Warming causes contrasting spider behavioral responses by changing their prey size spectra
2. This file contains codes for data analysis, including the contents as follow:
  a. The (Generalized) linear mixed model determining the warming effect on spider abundance, body size and web-building behavior. 
  b. The structural equation model determining the direct and indirect effects of warming on spider behavior and abundance using piecewiseSEM. 
3. The annotations are shown in the code file.
